## NOTE ##
# If a hook is set here then it will be used for all
# certificates and will override any per certificate
# hook configuration in place.

# Command to be run in a shell before obtaining any
# certificates. Intended primarily for renewal, where it
# can be used to temporarily shut down a webserver that
# might conflict with the standalone plugin. This will
# only be called if a certificate is actually to be
# obtained/renewed. When renewing several certificates
# that have identical pre-hooks, only the first will be
# executed.
#
# An example to stop the MTA before updating certs would be
# PRE_HOOK="--pre-hook 'systemctl stop postfix'"
PRE_HOOK=""

# Command to be run in a shell after attempting to
# obtain/renew certificates. Can be used to deploy
# renewed certificates, or to restart any servers that
# were stopped by --pre-hook. This is only run if an
# attempt was made to obtain/renew a certificate. If
# multiple renewed certificates have identical post-
# hooks, only one will be run.
#
# An example to restart httpd would be:
# POST_HOOK="--post-hook 'systemctl restart httpd'"
POST_HOOK="'nginx -s reload'"

# Command to be run in a shell once for each
# successfully renewed certificate. For this command,
# the shell variable $RENEWED_LINEAGE will point to the
# config live subdirectory containing the new certs and
# keys; the shell variable $RENEWED_DOMAINS will contain
# a space-delimited list of renewed cert domains
#
# An example to run a script to alert each cert would be:
# DEPLOY_HOOK="--deploy-hook /usr/local/bin/cert-notifier.sh"
DEPLOY_HOOK=""

# Any other misc arguments for the renewal
# See certbot -h renew for full list
#
# An example to force renewal for certificates not due yet
# CERTBOT_ARGS="--force-renewal"
